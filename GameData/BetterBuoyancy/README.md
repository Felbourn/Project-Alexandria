Better Buoyancy, v1.4
=========================

A KSP mod that uses double precision measurements for buoyancy calculations and allows for high-speed horizontal ditching.

Density can also be configured per-CelestialBody by using the config file to set density for a particular body index.  
The default density value can also be set.
