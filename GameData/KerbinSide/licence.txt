Addendum 1: You may modify the contents for personal use but may not re-distribute modified versions of the content without obtaining permission first. Contact Ashley Hall on the KSP forums, PMing the user AlphaAsh.
Addendum 2: This work may not be re-distributed, modified or unmodified in a 'mod pack'.

Exceptions:
Re-distribution of exported custom or modified configuration files is allowed without permission. Addendum 1 and 2 of this licence also do not apply and are waived in this case. This licence must still be included. All other content may not be re-distributed and if you re-distribute modified configuration files, you must make links to the pre-requisite content available where appropriate (such as in a forum post or readme file). You must also be first-point for any support necessary for your mod and where it is deemed appropriate by the original mod authors.

This exception will be withdrawn from the licence if ANY abuse of said licence or this exception is believed to have occurred by the license holder.
