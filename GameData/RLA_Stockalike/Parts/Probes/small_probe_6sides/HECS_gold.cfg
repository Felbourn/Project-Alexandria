description = A common complaint that Prodobodyne receives is that probe cores aren't cool enough. To fix that, they found some very fancy looking gold foil and included it on their modernised product line. Across the board software upgrades and some advanced components make these updated probes stand out from the crowd, and the HECS in particular has some very capable reaction wheels to boot.
