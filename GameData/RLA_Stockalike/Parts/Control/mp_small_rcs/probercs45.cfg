title = RM-105-45 Micro RCS Block
manufacturer = STEADLER Engineering Corps
description = Extending STEADLERs product line further, these RCS thrusters should provide just enough thrust to dock a probe sized craft quickly, or a full sized craft slowly. Designed for 45 degree offset placement to allow for cardinal direction translation. Useful on certain command pods and other components.
