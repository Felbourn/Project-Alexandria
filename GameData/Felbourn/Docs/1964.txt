upping requirements to orbital missions

November 22, 1963: President John F. Kennedy is shot and killed in Dallas, Texas. As a tribute, President Lyndon Johnson changes the name of the rocket launch site--Cape Canaveral--to Cape Kennedy. Although the name change will be approved by the United States Board on Geographic Names of the Interior Department in 1964, it is never popular in Florida, especially in the city of Cape Canaveral. In 1973 the state will pass a law restoring the former 400-year-old name.

greetings K
you just watched the saturn I sa-5 launch from cape ken, which was not the launch site's name last year
it was called cape can then
but president johnson got it renamed to cape ken after the former presiden't assassination
the name was not very popular in florida, however, and in 1973 the site will get renamed back to cape can

today is jan 29, which is the same day the cold war spoof by Stanley Kubrick is being released, called
Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb
I first saw that in 1984. well actuially it was hte only time i saw it
It's was a... strange movie, but sure had  a memorable ending

anyway the saturn I block 2 here is the launch that JFK had predicted would place the nited state launch capabilities ahead of the soviet union for hte first time
if you look at a graph of moon launch capability, it probably looked like this...
(explain)
though arguably it couldbe said that the real crossover point was in another year and a half after the US has carried out various activities like rendezvous and space walk

January 29, 1964: Columbia Pictures releases the black comedy,. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, the film is a Cold War spoof, and one of the top-rated comedy movies of all time. The story revolves around a United States Air Force general, who orders a first strike nuclear attack on the Soviet Union. The film's opening frames feature this disclaimer:
It is the stated position of the United States Air Force that their safeguards would prevent the occurrence of such events as are depicted in this film. Furthermore, it should be noted that none of the characters portrayed in this film are meant to represent any real persons living or dead.
The title character, Dr. Strangelove, is a former Nazi physicist, serving as science advisor to the president of the United States. He is prone to accidentally addressing the President as Mein Fuehrer during moments of stress. Despite the disclaimer, Strangelove is an amalgamation of RAND Corporation strategist Herman Kahn, atom scientists Edward Teller and John von Neumann, and Wernher von Braun.

The cold war raged on through all of this, or more accurately because of this. A soviet newspaper verbally attacked Wernher von Braun calling him a nazi, and claiming he created inhuman working conditions for workers at an underground Nazi rocket base in Poland while working with adaolf hitler during ww2.

August 6, 1964: The Washington Post reports on a story published in the Soviet newspaper Izvestia:
Izvestia - attacked American rocket expert Wernher von Braun, for "creating inhuman conditions" among workers at an underground Nazi rocket base in Poland, [sic] which he reportedly headed during World War II. Von Braun, Izvestia said, did so "to carry out the promise given to Hitler of a miracle weapon."

We have dropped away stage 1 and burned out stage 2. The payload for this flight was ballast, so we're leaving it attached and thus the whole upper stage is the payload.
The test was completed successfullyand this stage will eventually deorbit and burn up in 1966.

Later in the year NASA will launch flights #6 and #7, which will be the first two flights to have the Command Service Module attached. I won't be showing those, but those flights are also most successful.

-------------------------------------------------------
On apr 12 1964, before the other two saturn launches of the year, we're testing the first ever of the Gemini spacecraft. 
This, like all Gemini that will come after it, is being launched on a Titan II missile.
The Titan 1 was an ICBM, technically capable of orbital flight but once you load it with a 4 ton nuclear warhead it becomes suborbital, which was fine for missiles. We need to send 4 ton manned payloads into orbit though, so we're using a modified Titan II.

Mission control this time is in Houston, not florida, which is the first time Houston is being used for flight mission control.
We're launching from Cape Kennedy launch complex 19, and all future gemini missions will launch from here as well.

What's really intgeresting is that Gemini craft were technically more advanced spacecraft than Apollo in many ways. The saturn launch vehivles and capsule plans have been in development for years now. Apollo was intended to be a series of tests after Mercury, and was not intended to go to the moon. Gemini was going to go to the moon after the Apollo tests were completed. However, delays in the Apollo program made is clear to NASA that we would not make it to the moon before the end of the decade if we didn't change plans. The time gap between Mercuryt and Apollo was going ot be years, and there was too much space training that still needed to be done. 
So in 1962 the US started looking at configurations involving Apollo for moon landing, and Gemini moved to the front of the line for followup missions to the Mercury program.
The gemini capsules were even called Mercury Mark II at first, and only later renamed to Gemini. 
Engineers were able to incprorate all their knowledge and learned techniques into Gemini desoign and construction, making it technically more advanced than Apollo. 
There were all kinds of plans for how Gemini would be used to go to the moon, land, return, and how to deal with safe reentry and landing. There were even plans for how to make 12-man Gemini missions and space station development. All those plans were eventually scrapped, and Apollo became the moon missions project instead.

Our Gemini has made it to orbit. The only problem was it went into a slightly higbher orbit than expected. 270 km wasdesired, but about 320 km was achieved. The perigee was 160 km, so the drag at perigee pulled the craft down after only 4 days. It deorbited over the south atlanta ocean. THe capsule was not decoupled from the upper stage, so the retro rockets were not tested with this flight. That would occur with gemii 2, whioch was supposed to fly in december, but would not actually launch until next year.

I want to get (or program) a simple mod that calculates the perfect angle for a rocket flight. I can extract the current stage delta-v of a craft from internal KSP vars pretty easily. In fact, MJ and KER do this already, so I could just steal their code for stage dV. From stage dV and an input parameter of desired final apoapsis, I want to get back a target angle relative to the horizon that the craft should be pointing toward such that: "when the stage burns out, the craft will be at the desired altitude if this target angle was maintained up until burnout." I sort of know how to do that math, but perhaps it has already been done? Real rockets do this every launch. Someone must have this handy, or maybe it exists for KSP already?
