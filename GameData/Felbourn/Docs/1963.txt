June 19 – Valentina Tereshkova the first woman in space, returns to Earth.

It's June 16, 1963 and we have a new first underway. This is Vostok 6, and in the capsule is Valentina Tereshkova. She is about to be the first woman into space, another first for the Soviet Union. The United States had a distinctly male-centric view of difficult physical tasks, such as for example spaceflight. The general male attitude in the U.S. during this time period was that a woman's place was in the home, and that they were too fragile for space. The male-dominated United States was very frustrating for woman like, for example, Trudy Cooper who had been a flight instructor. She tried very hard to get NASA to allow woman, and she wanted to be an astronaut herself, but NASA continually refused. Instead, Valentina shall be the first woman in space, and shatter any notions that woman couldn't handle the trip, even though I don't think she'd have called the trip pleasant. Despite proving it was possible, no other woman would go to space for another 19 years.

Now, remember, I need to start skipping things here and there, especially when they are not major Firsts in some way. Going back to Trudy Cooper for a second, her husband was Gordon Cooper, who was the last Mercury astronaut into space, and he launched in Mercury-Atlas 9 one month before this flight of  Valentina in Vostok 6. Cooper's flight would end up being the last of the Mercury program because the 10th launch was cancelled 3 days before Valentina's flight. NASA administrator James E. Webb went before congress and said the program was complete, and they started focusing on upcoming Gemini flights instead.

As for Valentina, you might be remembering that last episode had Vostoks 3 and 4. What happened to 5? Well 5 was launched 2 days before this, but I am not going to show it. It's another of the flights we need to skip so that we can have enough time to watch all the major Firsts. Just assume cosmonaut Valery Bykovsky is already in orbit right now, in Vostok 5. Valentina's flight is targeting Vostok 5 to attempt another simulated rendezvous. Like 3 and 4 bnefore this, it's just a really accurate launch, and not really a rendezvous. Also like 3 and 4 before this, it succeeds. Valentina and Bykovsky are able to remain in radio contact, and later when they reenter they are only 3 hours apart, which basically means they were still near each other but Bykovsky got to orbit 2 more times before his retros were fired.

Neither Bykovsky nor Valentina's flight was entirel;y pleasant. Bykovsky had a problem with his waste collection system. I think you can imagine what that might mean. Valentina got space sick and had other aches nad pains, but didn't want to report the full extent of her status, which probably means she was really not doing well at all.

Valentina was actually a civilan. She was originally a textile factory assembly worker, and was selected from a candidate pool of over 400 female applicants. So she also because the first civilian in space, and as I said earlier Bykovsky set the new duration record after his 5-day flight.

Valentina came down first, and of course ejected and parachuted to the group as you did with these missions. That's ok becuase she was a master skydiver, which was a big part of why she had been selected for this flight.

Due to solar flare activity and an unstable orbit, Bykovsky's flight that was supposed to stay up 8 days was brought back after only 5. Nonetheless, his flight remains the record for SOLO manned spaceflight since all future launches were either shorter or not solo.

July 19 – American test pilot Joe Walker, flying the X-15, reaches an altitude of 65.8 miles (105.9 kilometers), making it a sub-orbital spaceflight by recognized international standards.

August 28 – Martin Luther King Jr. delivers his "I Have a Dream" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial to an audience of at least 250,000, during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.

November 10 – Malcolm X makes an historic speech in Detroit, Michigan ("Message to the Grass Roots").

November 22
Assassination of John F. Kennedy: In a motorcade in Dallas, Texas, United States President John F. Kennedy is shot by Lee Harvey Oswald, and Governor of Texas John Connally is seriously wounded. A few hours later new President Lyndon B. Johnson is sworn in aboard Air Force One, as Kennedy's body is flown back to Washington, D.C. All television coverage for the next 4 days is devoted to the assassination and its aftermath, the November 24 procession of the horsedrawn casket to the United States Capitol rotunda, and the funeral. Stores and businesses shut down for the entire weekend and Monday, in tribute.

November 24
Lee Harvey Oswald, assassin of John F. Kennedy, is shot dead by Jack Ruby in Dallas, an event seen on live national television. Later that night, a hastily arranged program, A Tribute to John F. Kennedy from the Arts, featuring actors, opera singers, and noted writers, all performing dramatic readings and/or music, is telecast on ABC-TV.
