** January 9 – Cuba and the Soviet Union signed a trade pact.

> greetings...
it's 1962, a troubling and dangerous time for the world, but we'll get into that in a moment
right now it's jan 26 and we're launching out of cape canaveral, LC-12
heading to space today is an atlas LV3 agena-B carrying the Ranger 3 moon probe crafted by the JPL
in the background you can see some special props used to make it look like this is the real KSC, which you can get from the kerbal forums just like i did
also, keep your eyes on the engine plumes because I am using real plume, a mod that simulates the true changes to plumes from atmospheric pressure going down as we gain altitude 
so, Ranger 3 weighs 328 kg total, but the united states is hoping to hard-land just one small round capsule from it on the surface of the moon in a couple days
first we need to get to orbit, which we will be doing in the background as we learn a little about why 1962 had the survival of the world balancing on the head of a pin
it started earlier in the month, when on Jan 9th the Sovet union and Cuba signed a trade pact
4 years before this the united states made a deal with Turkey to station nuclear missions in their country
Turkey is a stone's throw from the soviet union, which means very limited response time to U.S. a nuclear attack, so the USSR started looking for allies near the united states in return
they found one in cuba

that goes back a few years to a revolution in Cuba where the U.S. allied leader named Batista was overthrown by fidel castro
this was followed up by a failed invasion by the united states trying to retake cuba, called the bay of pigs invasion
over a 1000 captives of the invasion are still being held in cuba at this point, so far without a trial

a week after this Ranger 3 launch the united states will declare an embargo on cuba and
a few days after that the U.S. will offically banned all Cuban imports and exports within the united states

meanwhile we're continuing with the space race, because this tension with the US and the USSR is only getting started

January 26 – Ranger 3 was launched to study the Moon; it later missed the Moon by 22,000 miles.

** February 3 – The United States embargo against Cuba was announced.
** February 7 The United States Government banned all U.S.-related Cuban imports and exports.

February 20 – Project Mercury: While aboard Friendship 7, John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth, three times in 4 hours, 55 minutes.
20.02.1962	Mercury MA-6 (Mercury 13)	Atlas-D Mercury	CC LC-14

The water popping in and out is a side effect of playing RSS, and I'm still trying to get that fixed up.
So, we'll move ahead to Feb 20, 1962 now, and we're at LC-14 in CC. John H Glenn Jr is taking off to head into space and be the first American in orbit.
As we leave the surface, you can see I have done a little more work on the pads. My Ranger 3 was done from a pad while testing out the Kerbal Konstructs & real KSC mods.
Now I've built out a whole section of pads for Missile Row in CC and I'll keep working on this part of my base as time goes by.
Anyway, if we use this event as a measuring stick against the Sovient Union, we're 314 days behind them in the space race at this point.
As mentioned in a previous episode, each Mercury capsule had a name given to it by its pilot, and then with a 7 after it to denote the 7 astronauts of the mercury program.
Glenn named this one Friendship 7. It's being lifted on an Atlas LV-3B just like my earlier Ranger 3 launch.
In this case there's no upper stage because we're only trying to achieve low earth orbit.
There were many delays that plagued this launch, but we're finally on our way.
There were a number of glitches with the flight as well. The attitude control system sometimes worked, sometimes didn't, and ultimately ran out of fuel too early during decent.
Also a faulty indicator light made the ground crew wonder if the landing bag that sits between the capsule and heat shield had accidentally deployed early.
Glenn did not report hearing any banging noises while using the ACS, but the ground crew was not taking any chances. They ordered that the reto package not be jettisoned after use, in the hope that the straps holding it on might also hold the heat shield in place better. This was a risky call because if there was NO problem with the heat shield then leaving the reto package on might actually end up damaging the otherwise perfect shield, and could cause a problem during reentry. The reto package also changed the aerodynamics of the craft for reentry and Glenn reported that the capsule was falling like a leaf in the wind, wagging back and forth.

While Friendship 7 continues on and ultimately reenters i the background, I'm going to skip ahead in time again. I want to devote each episode to just one year of history from now on, and that means needing to skip something that happened, and gloss over other events in space history. Rather than launching them, I'm mention them.
The first mention is for the OSO 1. That stands for Orbiting Solar Observatory and it was launched March 7 1962. It was launched on Delta rocket, which to me looks a lot like a Thor-Able. It was the first satellite designed for extended studies of the sun, and reported back data on UV light, X-rays, and gamma radiation. There wouldk be 7 more OSO satellites launched pover time, going up through 1975.

In April, a Cuban military tribunal convicted the Bay of Pigs attackers that had been captured.
Meanwhile about a week after that we launched Ranger 4 to the moon, but this one failed to impact as well.

In May, Scott Carpenter orbitted the Earth in Aurora 7. The mission was largely the same as the Friendship 7 flight. He lifted off in the same kind of rocket, on the same kind of day, from the same exact launch tower LC-14, into the same kind of orbit for the same amount of time. He even had ACS issues with the capsule. The science experiments carried out were different.

And then we move to July. We attempted a Mariner launch, but it failed. We did manage to launch the first true communications satellite, Telstar 1 on a Thor-Delta rocket. It was responsible for many firsts though. Telstar did the first television pictures, phone calls, and fax messages transmitted through space. It was the first privately sponsored launch. It allowed us to syncronize time between two continents for the first time.

We'll move ahead now to August, and switch locales to the Soviet Union. You can see I've been working on building a Cosmodrome launch site in Khazakstan using the Kerbal Konstructs mod, so we'll be lauching from this time. Atop a Vostok rocket is Andriyan Nikolayev. THe USSR is about to carry out a new, ground breaking test. Tomorrow they will be launching another cosmonaut, Pavel Popovich, into a nearly synchronous orbit with Nikolayev. In fact, they'll be so close together that the United States and the rest of the world will be lead to believe the Soviets have on-orbit maneuvering and rendezvous capabilities that they don't actually have. 
The Soviets of course did not set the facts straight when people started assuming it. If they wanted to make assumptions, let them.
The truth is their timing and launch control were just about perfect. This is Vostok 3, and later I'll be launching my own second, Vostok 4, to attempt a rendezvous direct from the surface. Actually I tried it three times as I was getting the hang of it in RSS. THe Soviet Union had lots of scientists and computers to do this for them automatically. I'm trying to do it by eye, and let me tell you it's a lot harder in RSS than regular KSP. THe orbits are SO close to the surface of the planet that there's very little room for error. Also, it's physically harder to see them. THe edge of hte planet can overwhelm the lines being drawn for the orbits.
Anyway, as I said we'll launch Vostok 4 after this, and while the Soviets got with 6.5 km of each other, I get within about 21 km. Technically I got with 4.5 km but then I decoupled the capsule and the force of it alone sent me forward enough to separate the two craft by another 18 km. Still... they were very close in relative terms, and stayed that way for a long time. In the real world Nikolayev and Popovich stayed in contact via radio, and at one point Popovich claimed he could see the other craft. He said  "It looked like a very small moon in the distance." 
So let's get back to some firsts, because Alexandria is mostly about "firsts in spaceflight history." This was the first time there were two separate manned crafts in orbit at the same time. Nikolayev unstrapped himself and became the first to floated freely inside a spaceship. Both cosmonauts were the first to do serious study of the effects of space on humans, including analyzing space sickness that had been reported on the earlier Vostok flights.
The two men launched one day apart, and then stayed in orbit for 3-4 days each. Nikolayev landed first, and then Popovich came down just 7 minutes later, not that far away from Vostok 3. Popovich was supposed to stay up longer, but I geuss there was confusion between him and the ground crew, and they thought he had given the code word to come down early, so they fired his retros and he descended.

We'll come back to vostok 3 because i need to get vostok 4 into orbit now. I'll gloss over some of the launch, the parts that are largely identical to Vostok 3. I'll just cover my attempted rendezvous, and meanwhile we'll get back to some firsts...

So while we wait for the rendezvous to finish, let's see what else happened in 1962.
The Soviet Union's Venera probe was launched toward Venus but failed to send back any data. Twice.
With the launch window open, the United States launched two probes of their own, Mariners.
Mariner 1 failed but Mariner 2 was more successufl. I'll cover that launch in a moment.
Canada launched their first satellitw in '62, Alouette, AND it was the first satellite built outside the united state and soviet union.
Project Mercury launched Wally Shirra in Sigma 7, which was an Atlas launch like at the beginning of this video.
In Sept of '62 President Kennedy visited Rice University and gavce one of the most memorable speches in spaceflight history.
