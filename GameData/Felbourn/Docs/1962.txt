** January 9 – Cuba and the Soviet Union signed a trade pact.

> greetings...
it's 1962, a troubling and dangerous time for the world, but we'll get into that in a moment
right now it's jan 26 and we're launching out of cape canaveral, LC-12
heading to space today is an atlas LV3 agena-B carrying the Ranger 3 moon probe crafted by the JPL
in the background you can see some special props used to make it look like this is the real KSC, which you can get from the kerbal forums just like i did
also, keep your eyes on the engine plumes because I am using real plume, a mod that simulates the true changes to plumes from atmospheric pressure going down as we gain altitude 
so, Ranger 3 weighs 328 kg total, but the united states is hoping to hard-land just one small round capsule from it on the surface of the moon in a couple days
first we need to get to orbit, which we will be doing in the background as we learn a little about why 1962 had the survival of the world balancing on the head of a pin
it started earlier in the month, when on Jan 9th the Sovet union and Cuba signed a trade pact
4 years before this the united states made a deal with Turkey to station nuclear missions in their country
Turkey is a stone's throw from the soviet union, which means very limited response time to U.S. a nuclear attack, so the USSR started looking for allies near the united states in return
they found one in cuba

that goes back a few years to a revolution in Cuba where the U.S. allied leader named Batista was overthrown by fidel castro
this was followed up by a failed invasion by the united states trying to retake cuba, called the bay of pigs invasion
over a 1000 captives of the invasion are still being held in cuba at this point, so far without a trial

a week after this Ranger 3 launch the united states will declare an embargo on cuba and
a few days after that the U.S. will offically banned all Cuban imports and exports within the united states

meanwhile we're continuing with the space race, because this tension with the US and the USSR is only getting started
