	description = A space craft of non-Kerbin origin. It was found in the desert and re-purposed for the Kerbin Space Program. With its advanced alien tech and spacious cockpit, Kerbin scientist knew it would thrust their work ahead by at least 6 weeks. Includes interior lights, intigrated 11 hour battery and mono-propellant powered fuel cell.

//REENTRY MODULE 
//Crew size: 2 
//Length: 3.4 m 
//Maximum diameter: 2.3 m 
//Habitable volume: 2.55 m3 
//Total mass: 1,982 kg 
//(structure 638 kg; heat shield 144 kg; reaction control system 133 kg; recovery equipment 98 kg; navigation equipment 63 kg; telemetry equipment 51 kg; electrical equipment 126 kg; communications systems 26 kg; crew seats & provisions 426 kg; crew mass 144 kg; misc contingency 100 kg; propellant 33 kg) 
//Reaction control system 
//    thrusters: duplicate sets of 8 x 111 N thrusters 
//    propellant: NTO/MMH 
//    specific impulse: 283 s 
//    total impulse: 90 kNs 
//L/D hypersonic: 0.16 
//Power: batteries; 4.0 kWh, 180.0 Ah 
//Environment: pure oxygen at 340 mbar 
//Landing system: similar to Mercury, except no landing bag. Main parachute 25.6 m diameter ringsail. Original landing mode called for deployment of a inflated Rogallo wing with a piloted landing on skids at Edwards Dry Lake. The wing could not be made to deploy reliably before flights began, so the capsule made a parachute-borne water landing
