	description = A proven aluminium skin stringer design derived from fairings used on earlier Atlas-Centaur rockets. The LPF features an increased diameter main body an a longer nosecone than its predecessors. First used on Atlas I, it has been the mainstay of the aluminium fairing series for Atlas ever since.
