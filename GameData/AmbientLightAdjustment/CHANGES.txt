1.2.0, 2014-08-21
- The plugin now also works in the tracking station.
- The slider will now auto-hide automatically after a few seconds of inactivity.
- The toolbar button is now only accessible in the relevant game scenes rather
  than all game scenes.

1.1.3, 2014-07-27
- The plugin now does an automatic update check, and also gets KSP versions from
  the update check server. In case the currently running KSP version is one of
  those versions, the plugin will not complain about being incompatible with this
  KSP version. This saves both players' and the plugin author's time.
