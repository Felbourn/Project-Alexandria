This plugin extends the usable area when building in the SPH or VAB, so you can build outside or above the building. Useful for building large aircraft carriers or tall rockets.

To scale the Hangar press the * on the numpad. This key is reconfigurable in settings.txt.
For the custom key to work, the settings.txt file MUST be placed in GameData\FShangarExtender\settings.txt
