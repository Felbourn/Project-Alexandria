===Dependencies===

 - AnimatedDecouplers (Starwaster), for umbilical animation on decoupling, as well as adding stock drag occlusion support for the Boost Protect Cover and Service Module side fairings

 - ModuleManager (sarbian), for applying patches for functionality/features provided by dependencies and third-party add-ons

 - Wenkel Corporation RealChute Parachute Systems (stupid_chris), for parachute functionality


===Supported Third-Party Addons===

 - Deadly Reentry Continued (NathanKell / Starwaster) - if installed, the SDHI Heat Shield will protect the Mk1-2 Pod from the heat and stresses of atmospheric reentry; most other Service Module components will also consistently be burned up when deorbited

 - Ferram Aerospace Research (ferram4) - if installed, the Boost Protective Cover and Service Module Fairings will properly shield other components from aerodynamic stresses experienced during launch, reducing drag and making your rockets more efficient at getting into orbit

 - HotRockets! (Nazari1382) - if installed, the LV-909 variant included in the Service Module pack will display improved particle effects in its exhaust

 - Klockheed Martian Special Parts (dtobi / raidernick), for self-inflating floation collar functionality

 - Ship Manifest (Papa_Joe) and Connected Living Spaces API (codepoet) - if installed, crew can be transferred between vessels that use the parachute-equipped docking ports included in the Service Module pack

 - TAC Life Support (TaranisElsu) - if installed, will add a total of Kerbin eight day's worth of life support provisions to the Mk1-2 Pod and Service Module, plus Carbon Extractors and Water Filters 


===How To Install===

1. Ensure that you have all of the aforementioned dependencies installed

2. Remove any previous version of the SDHI SMS add-on

3. Download

4. Extract the .ZIP archive and copy the GameData folder provided into your KSP root directory

The parts should then be located under the SDHI/Service Module System folder



===Usage===

 - This parts pack is specifically designed for use with the stock Mk1-2 Command Pod

 - For assembly and configuration instructions, refer to http://github.com/sumghai/SDHI_ServiceModuleSystem/wiki/How-to-assemble-&-configure-a-complete-SDHI-CSM-stack

 - No Launch Escape Systems or Escape Towers are included in this pack; either build your own using stock parts, or try the ones from KSPX or BFGfreak's Prilla LES add-ons.



===Uninstallation Instructions===

Remove the SDHI folder and all its contents from the GameData folder.

If you have other SDHI part packs you wish to keep, just remove the Service Module System subfolder.


===Release Notes===
3.0.1 - 10 July 2015
---------------------------

Changes / Fixes:
 - Compatibility Patch for KSP 1.0.4
 - Heat shield is now compatible with 1.0.4's updated thermal system
    - Deadly Reentry support has also been updated accordingly, and the corresponding patch is now compatible with DRE 7.2.x
 -  Fallback patch for stock parachute behaviour has been updated
    - Deployment altitude increased to 1000m
    - Minimum air pressure required to open reduced to 0.04 kPa
    - Both values are comparable to stock parachute part performance
    - Note: RealChute is still the recommended default

Bugs/Known Issues
 - Mk 1-2 Pod Umbilical Port is now also toggleable outside of the VAB/SPH editor scenes
    - This is due to a limitation with the current stock KSP ModuleAnimateGeneric behaviour, but is not game-breaking.
 - Part testing contracts are generated in Career Mode
    - This not intended behaviour, since the SDHI SMS is intended to be tested as a complete assembled stack rather than in piecemeal
    - A future update might include a proper contract for testing the SDHI SMS
    
    
3.0 - 11 June 2015
---------------------------

WARNING: This is a potentially craft and save-breaking update; it is recommended you abort / recover existing SDHI craft before installing this update

Changes / Fixes:
 - Compatibility Patch for KSP 1.0.x
 - The Service Module's fuel cell now uses the new stock ModuleResourceConverter system, and has the same performance as its stock standalone counterpart
 - Stack attachment node directions have been updated to conform with 1.0.x stricter definitions
    - The Node Resizer plugin is no longer required when attaching the Heat Shield to the pod, Service Module or Avionics Ring
 - All textures have been converted to DDS format for faster loading and reduced memory usage
 - A bright patch on the Pod Boost Protective Cover has been fixed
 - The Heat Shield is now compatible with the new stock reentry system
    - Ablative darkening is not used in SDHI SMS, and has been disabled
    - Deadly Reentry is still supported, and the corresponding patch is now compatible with DRE 7.x
 - The fairingless LV-909 engine has been updated to have similar performance to its stock counterpart
 - The Service Module colliders have now been fixed, so that surface-attached parts like solar panels and RCS thrusters should no longer float out from the lower propulsion trunk segment
 - The Service Module Adapter textures have been reworked to be visually consistent with the Service Module upper ring itself
 - The Pod Boost Protective Cover and Service Module Fairings are now fully compatible with the new stock aerodynamics system
    - This requires the latest version of the AnimatedDecouplers plugin, which provides special versions of the standard decoupler/jettison PartModules in order for the stock ModuleCargoBay to know when to update its drag occlusion behaviour
 - Removed Ferram Aerospace Research MM patch for Pod Boost Protect Cover
    - The latest versions of FAR now intrinsically and automatically handle drag occlusion for hollow parts, making such patches redundant
 - Fixed HotRockets! MM patch for the fairingless LV-909 engine

Bugs/Known Issues
 - Mk 1-2 Pod Umbilical Port is now also toggleable outside of the VAB/SPH editor scenes
    - This is due to a limitation with the current stock KSP ModuleAnimateGeneric behaviour, but is not game-breaking.
 - Part testing contracts are generated in Career Mode
    - This not intended behaviour, since the SDHI SMS is intended to be tested as a complete assembled stack rather than in piecemeal
    - A future update might include a proper contract for testing the SDHI SMS


2.4        27 December 2014
---------------------------

Changes / Fixes:
 - Compatibility Patch for KSP 0.90.0
 - Added Editor Part List Filter By Manufacturer Icon for SDHI
 - Heat shield floatation collar powered by Klockheed Martian Special Parts now considered an optional feature instead of a depedency

Bugs/Known Issues
 - In the VAB/SPH editor scenes, When surface-attaching solar panels and other small parts to the ribbed propulsion trunk segment of the Service Module, the parts will sometimes appear to be suspended a fair distance away from the surface
    - The problem generally occurs when angle snap is enabled, possibly due to editor scene changes in KSP 0.90.0
    - No known fix
 - Part testing contracts are generated in Career Mode
    - This not intended behaviour, since the SDHI SMS is intended to be tested as a complete assembled stack rather than in piecemeal
    - A future update might include a proper contract for testing the SDHI SMS


2.3        10 October 2014
---------------------------

Changes / Fixes:
 - Compatibility Patch for KSP 0.25.x
 - Updated references and scaling factors in stock parts used by SDHI (such as the Fairingless LV-909 and Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port - Parachute version)

    - IACBM fins, Boost Protect Cover hatch and Mk 1-2 Pod Umbilical Port remain toggleable in the VAB/SPH editor scenes
    - Firespitter plugin is no longer required, and has been dropped from the list of dependencies
 - Added fallback patch for stock parachute behaviour if RealChute is absent
    - Note: RealChute is still the recommended default
    - Stock parachute behaviour only deploys main chutes, and should only be used in an emergency as it may cause sudden or craft-damaging deacceleration upon deployment  

Bugs/Known Issues
 - Mk 1-2 Pod Umbilical Port is now also toggleable outside of the VAB/SPH editor scenes
    - This is due to a limitation with the current stock KSP ModuleAnimateGeneric behaviour, but is not game-breaking.

2.2          29 August 2014
---------------------------

Changes / Fixes:
 - Added Node Resizer support
    - This dynamically changes the stack nodes of the Avionics Ring and Heat Shield to size 0 while in the VAB/SPH editor scenes, allowing for easier attachment (and thus fixing the "bouncing" attachment node bug)
    - When entering the flight scene, this automatically switches the node size back to 2 to ensure a strong structural connection as usual
 - New meshes, graphics and better details for the FusTek Karmony hatch on the IACBM parachute-equipped docking port
    - This is for compatibility / visual consistency with future versions of FusTek Station Parts


2.1.1        21 August 2014
---------------------------

 - Consolidated Service Module and Avionics Ring textures / subdirectories
 - Native FAR support for Boost Protective Cover
    - NOTE: When first installing FAR and/or SDHI, you must delete CustomFARPartClassification.cfg from your GameData\FerramAerospaceResearch\ folder in order for FAR to properly rebuild its part classification definitions to include the SDHI parts)
 - Reduced docking port spotlight range and intensities, as they are not intended for general illumination
 - Fixed Service Module rescaling bug that occurs on scene reload

 - Compatibility Patch for KSP 0.23.5
 - Fixed IACBM 1.25m - Parachute version docking light colors


1.8          20 March 2014
---------------------------

Changes / Fixes:
 - Reduced drag on Service Module, so that when it decouples from the Mk1-2 Command Pod just before re-entry it is less likely to bump back into it
 - Set Boost Protective Cover decoupler force to 0, as the ejection force is made redundant by the cover's own solid rocket motors


1.7          13 January 2014
---------------------------

Changes / Fixes:
 - Dropped FusTek_Sumghai.DLL in favour of external dependency on Snjo's Firespitter plugin
    - You will need to download and install the latest version of Firespitter yourself
    - This change now allows the IACBM guidance fins to be tweakable within the VAB/SPH


1.6          24 December 2013
---------------------------

Changes / Fixes:
 - Added new 0.23 EFFECTS{} for parachute sounds (stupid_chris)
 - Tweaked main parachute deployment altitude slightly; the mains will now deploy almost immediately after drogues are cut, instead of after a (decidedly terrifying) period of free-fall. 


1.5          8 December 2013
---------------------------

Changes / Fixes:
 - Compatibility upgrade to take advantage of new features in RealChute v0.3
    - Parachute drag is now dependent on effective canopy area rather than stock drag
    - Command Pod assembly will now hang under parachute anchor realistically without the need for the CoMOffset hack, and as such the latter has been removed


1.4          24 November 2013
---------------------------

Changes / Fixes:
 - Parachute-equipped docking ports now use stupid_chris's RealChute Parachute Systems plugin
    - Drogues will now auto-cut properly before automatically deploying the main chutes
    - Docking port lights can now be toggled normally during parachute deployment
    - This is not included in the pack, so you will need to download it separately
 - Updated drogue parachute textures to distinguish them from the main parachutes



1.3          8 November 2013
---------------------------

Features:
 - New Part
    - SDHI 2.5m Avionics Ring
 - Avionics Ring is essentially the upper decoupler portion of the full Service Module, with a bonus battery, reaction wheel and toggleable integrated fuel-to-electricity converter
    - This is particularly useful for people who want to build their own Service Module, but also use the SDHI Heat Shield and Boost Protective Cover 


1.2          25 October 2013
---------------------------

Changes:
 - VAB/SPH: Moved SDHI 2.5m Service Module Adapter and SDHI 2.5m Service Module Fairing to Aero tab
 - R&D: Moved SDHI 2.5m Service Module Adapter to "Supersonic Flight" node

    - "Heavier Rocketry" unlocks:
        - SDHI 2.5m Service Module
        - LV-909 Liquid Fuel Engine (Fairingless)



1.0          12 October 2013
---------------------------

Features:
 - Initial release
 - New parts
    - SDHI Mk1-2 Pod Boost Protective Cover
    - Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port - Parachute version
    - IACBM 1.25m - Parachute version
    - SDHI 2.5m Heat Shield
    - SDHI 2.5m Service Module
    - LV-909 Liquid Fuel Engine (Fairingless)
    - SDHI 2.5m Service Module Fairing
    - SDHI 2.5m Service Module Adapter
 - Boost Protective Cover is ogive-shaped to fit stock Mk1-2 Pod and any surface-attached accessories underneath
    - Staging activates both the shroud decoupler and jettison solid rocket motors
    - If shroud jettison is to be triggered via action groups, both the decoupler and the solid motors must be manually mapped to the same action key
 - Docking Ports come with short-range illumination lamps and integrated drogue/main parachute system
    - Clamp-O-Tron variant is compatible with stock standard-sized docking ports
    - IACBM variant is compatible with the FusTek Station Parts Expansion add-on
 - Service Module comes with:
    - Non-staged CM-SM decoupler to prevent accidental Pod/Service Module seperation during flight (action groups or right-click context menu used instead)
    - Toggleable integrated fuel-to-electricity converter for use


Bugs/Known Issues
 - Drogue parachutes do not auto-cut until mains are fully deployed
    - This is due to the use of *two* ModuleParachutes, which is technically "hacky" by KSP standards
    - Unlike BobCat's Orion spacecraft, however, the parachute-equipped docking ports will use the greater of the two drag configurations, guaranteeing a safe landing
        - Warranty void if parachutes are deployed on a planetary body other than Kerbin
 - Docking Port Lights become untoggleable after parachute deployment
    - This is because of the way KSP handles animations; the game can only save the state of one animation at a time, and the docking ports need several animations to handle the various parachute deployment stages and the lights.
