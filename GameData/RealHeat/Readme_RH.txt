RealHeat v1.0

This is a simple mod to correct some temperature-related things in KSP's thermal model. Later it will replace things wholesale, building on the work of goozeman and SRFirefox in addition to those above.

Right now it will:
* Calculate a shock temperature based on atmospheric composition and velocity.
* Calculate gamma based on atmospheric composition and velocity.
* Recalculate background radiation temperature (and the density-based interpolation factor used there and in other things) based on the above.

Installation:
Extract RealHeat folder and ModularFlightIntegrator folders to GameData.

Changelog:
v1.1
* Supports changing aeroFX now. Defaults to making it intense down low, so you can set the normal aeroFX settings to much lower scaling to not have flames on ascent. Supports aeroFXdensityExponent1 (default = 2.0) and aeroFXdensityMult1 default = 90), and the final density passed to aeroFX will be (density^aeroFXdensityExponent1 * aeroFXdensityMult1 + density^PhysicsGlobals.aeroFXDensityExponent) instead of just density^PhysicsGlobals.aeroFXDensityExponent.


v1.0
* Initial release version of RealHeat for KSP 1.0.4.
