I try extremely hard to make this mod as compatible and bug free as possible but I can not guarantee that it will work flawlessly in every situation and on every system.
This just releases my liability in those situations.

You, the user of the mod takes full responsibility for any damage, real or simulated that may happen to any system or device it is downloaded to or installed on. Also by using this software you release anyone else from any liability for any damages, forever.
