#### What is it?

QuickHide is a plugin which adds the possibility to hide the stock toolbar and the mods of the stock toolbar.

Unzip all files. Put the QuickHide folder in your KSP/GameData folder.

#### How to update it?

Unzip all files. Merge the new QuickHide folder with the old folder which is in your KSP/GameData folder.
