description = Introducing the RoboStrut, a specialised strut for holding parts of a spacecraft together. Made in collaboration with Kerlington Model Rockets and Paper Products Inc, this strut includes clever computation & control circuitry (C4) that allows it to decouple its two ends on-demand, making it ideal for holding robotic parts in place during launch. This is the smaller Lite version.
