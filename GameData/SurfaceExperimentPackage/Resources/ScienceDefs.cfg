		PoltaSrfLanded = Tidal heating makes a faint whirring sound beneath the surface. 
		PoltaSrfLanded = The tidal grumble is loud here.

		PriaxSrfLanded = Faint tidal stresses can be detected.

		WalSrfLandedEquatorialRidge = The sensor detects that sounds are moving very slowly through the ridge. Perhaps it is made of lose material?
		WalSrfLanded = The sensor detects faint amounts of interior noise, perhaps from plate tectonics?

		TalSrfLandedSurface = There are no interior sounds, but your landing can still be heard, echoing off the opposite side of the planet.
		TalSrfLandedImpactBasin = Setting up the equipment on this hard ground is remarkably easy.
		
		ThatmoSrfLanded = The thin atmosphere somewhat dampens the sensor in unpredictable ways.  
		ThatmoSrfLanded = The sensor detects faint sounds from the interior of the planet. Thatmoquake!

		NisseeSrfLanded = Unsurprisingly, the interior sounds like a small orchestra tuning up. Tidal heating is obviously at work.
		NisseeSrfLanded = The planet is remarkably nosy. You politely ask it to be quiet, you're trying to sleep here, but it doesn't listen.

		ErnusSrfLanded = The molten rock only propagates extremely low frequencies.
		ErnusSrfLanded = It's not very safe around here.

		ArinSrfLanded = You collect some very interesting data.
		ArinSrfLanded = There is very little liquid in the soil, making sounds propagate extremely well.
		
		AstidSrfLanded = Sounds resonate quite strangely off the rough surface.
		AstidSrfLanded = Noises in the planet indicate that something is going very strange with the core.

		DersoSrfLanded = Much of the planet is solid rock, making noises resonate quite strongly.
		DersoSrfLanded = It's actually quite simple to locate the remains of the asteroid that made the dent.

		ApturSrfLanded = The noise from your landing is still resonating, but strangely.
		ApturSrfLanded = Sounds propagate the weirdest way through this material, as though it has different densities in different axises?

		SerranSrfLanded = Samples from the shores show that the erosion of the surface was due to massive sink-holes developing over millennia.
		SerranSrfLanded = Compositions vary greatly in the craters, showing impacts ranging in materials.

		LaveSrfLanded = It's hard to hear anything down there.
		LaveSrfLanded = The planet damps many noises within it's crust quite strongly.

		NolasSrfLanded = The crust seems to be in sections, which transmit sound quite well within them, but poorly between them.
		NolasSrfLanded = You can hear your landing echoing off the various cracks in the planet.

		LeouchSrfLanded = The seismic environed is darned strange.
		LeouchSrfLanded = Sounds reflect strangely off the core of the planet, indicating gas pockets between core and surface.

		TitanusSrfLanded = There are a lot of noises down there.
		TitanusSrfLanded = This planet is almost constantly experiencing some form of geologicial activity.
