NEBULA Decals by Krasimir.

Installation:

Unzip the contents of the zip file directly to the KSP GameData folder, so the NEBULA folder ends up in the GameData catalog. For example: c:\games\KSP_win\GameData\NEBULA.

Making Your own decals:

1. make your desired texture with size by power of two - 128x128, 256x256, 512x512 etc.. pixels and save it as YourTexture.png in " \GameData\NEBULA\decals\textures\ " directory.
2. open the config.cfg and configc.cfg. Find the line " textureNames = " and add your texture name at the end of line with a semicolon before it.

Example: 

If your texture is named "Yourtexture.png", the line should look like:
textureNames = dcl2;nebula;esa1;esa2;nasa1;nasa2;roskosmos1;roskosmos2;energia1;euflag;usflag;ruflag;Yourtexture
